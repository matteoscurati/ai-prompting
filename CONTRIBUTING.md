# Contributing to ai-prompting

Thanks for considering a contribution. This project is small, opinionated, and easy to extend. The two principles to keep in mind:

1. **The CLI must remain deterministic.** No runtime dependencies, no LLM calls, no network access. Heuristics only.
2. **Model-specific advice belongs in `references/`, not in core code.** The TypeScript core stays vendor-neutral.

## Dev setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matteoscurati/ai-prompting.git
cd ai-prompting
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run doctor
```

Requires Node.js ≥ 18. The only devDeps are `typescript` and `@types/node`.

## Common contributions

### Adding a new option

`SKILL.md` § **Options** is the canonical definition of every option — its flag, values, default,
and effect. The slash command and the CLI are adapters that map their own syntax onto it; neither
redefines semantics.

1. Add the row to the Options table in `SKILL.md`.
2. Add the `flag → option` row to the table in `.claude/commands/improve.md`. Nothing else — no
   values, no prose. `tests/skill-md.test.ts` fails if the two tables disagree in either direction.
3. If the CLI implements it too, add it to the `VALID_*` unions and `buildOptions()` in
   `src/cli.ts`, and to `PromptImproverOptions` in `src/types.ts`.
4. Put the deep semantics in the relevant `references/*.md` file and link to the anchor from the
   Options table.

**Do not** copy procedure into `.claude/commands/improve.md`. It is an adapter: `$ARGUMENTS`
handling, the flag mapping, and the resolution ladder to `SKILL.md`. The decision flow, output
templates, padding list, scaffold, and choice block live in `SKILL.md` only, and the test suite
enforces their absence from the adapter.

### Adding a new task type

1. Add a regex pattern set to `TASK_TYPE_HINTS` in `src/prompt-improver.ts`.
2. Add `it` and `en` strings to `ROLE_BY_TASK` and `OUTPUT_FORMAT_BY_TASK`.
3. Document the scaffold in `references/prompt-patterns.md`.
4. Add a regression test in `tests/prompt-improver.test.ts`:
   ```ts
   test('inferTaskType: <new keywords> route to <new-type>', () => {
     assert.equal(inferTaskType('your sample prompt'), 'new-type');
   });
   ```

### Adding a new agent target

1. Append a section to `references/agent-compatibility.md` with the host's quirks.
2. If the adapter changes the scaffold structurally (rare), add a small branch in `prompt-improver.ts::buildScaffold` keyed on `opts.targetAgent`. Keep the branch ≤ 10 lines; push prose into the reference.

**The CLI has no `--target` flag on purpose.** It used to, and it did nothing —
`--target local` and `--target claude` produced byte-identical output while the
docs claimed the local adapter preserved "think step by step". Re-expose the flag
only together with a branch that actually fires and a test that proves it, of the
form "output for target A differs from target B in this specific way". A test
asserting the flag reaches the options object is not that test — that is exactly
the coverage `--target` and `--clarify` both had while being broken.
3. If the host has its own slash-command directory, add ~5 lines to `scripts/install-command.js`:
   ```js
   {
     label: 'New Host',
     dir: path.join(os.homedir(), '.newhost', 'commands'),
     filename: 'ai-prompting:improve.md',
   }
   ```
4. Verify with `npm run install-command -- --list` and `npm run install-command -- --dry-run --host newhost`.

### Adding a new padding pattern

1. Append a `{ re, label }` entry to `PADDING_PATTERNS` in `src/evaluator.ts`. Patterns must be **specific** (no false positives on legitimate text).
2. Add a regression test that asserts both: (a) the padding is removed from `improved`, (b) a `removed_padding` change is registered.
3. If the new pattern is language-specific, document it in `references/cost-control.md` under "Padding to strip".

### Adjusting the scoring rubric

The rubric is **the API contract** of the package. Changes affect every score people have published. Treat it as a breaking change unless you only add new categories.

1. Update `src/evaluator.ts` — adjust weights or add scoring functions in the `Features`-driven pattern (one pure function per category).
2. Update `references/prompt-quality-rubric.md` to match.
3. Update tests in `tests/evaluator.test.ts`.
4. Bump **minor** version (or major if total ≠ 100).
5. Document the rationale in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Style

- TypeScript strict mode. No `any` casts that aren't justified by an in-line comment.
- Pure functions where possible. The three core entrypoints (`scorePrompt`, `improvePrompt`, `runDoctor`) must remain pure (deterministic, no side effects beyond reading the filesystem in `runDoctor`).
- No comments narrating what the code does. Keep comments to non-obvious **why** only — hidden constraints, subtle invariants, workarounds.
- No new runtime dependencies. Devdeps require justification in the PR.

## Testing

```bash
npm test                                   # builds + runs node:test on dist/tests/*.test.js
node --test dist/tests/evaluator.test.js   # run a single test file after npm run build
```

A regression test is required for every behavior fix. Aim for one assertion per meaningful invariant — not one mega-test per function.

## Commit messages

Conventional, short subject + body explaining the **why**. Co-author lines welcome (humans and agents).

## Release flow

Maintainers only. The CLI's `prepublishOnly` hook runs `build + test` automatically.

```bash
# 1. Update CHANGELOG.md with the new version's section
$EDITOR CHANGELOG.md

# 2. Bump version (semver):
#    - patch: bug fix, no API change
#    - minor: new feature, no breaking change
#    - major: breaking change to API or rubric
npm version patch                       # or minor / major

# 3. Publish (prepublishOnly will gate on test+build):
npm publish

# 4. Push the tag:
git push --follow-tags
```

If `release.yml` is configured with `NPM_TOKEN`, pushing the tag also publishes via GitHub Actions — but a maintainer can still publish manually.

## Reporting bugs

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md). Include:

- the **input prompt** that triggered the bug,
- the **command line** or library call you used,
- the **observed output** vs the **expected output**,
- the package version (`ai-prompting --version`) and Node version (`node --version`).

For security issues, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). Do not open a public issue.
